# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, the Pillow library for image processing, and the requests library for accessing OpenWeatherMap's API. The app allows users to enter a city name and displays the current weather information for that city.

## Features
The app displays the following weather information for the entered city:

- Location: City, Country
